### Description
Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is an IT services, consulting and business solutions organisation that has been partnering with many of the worldâ€™s largest businesses for the past 50 years. Tcs believe innovation and collective knowledge can transform all our futures with greater purpose.

In this program, I have got an  opportunity to step into the shoes of a TCS team member and complete tasks that replicate the work that our ESG team does every day.I have  learnt how to understand and analyse a client and their needs, identify sustainability solutions for them and then present a final value proposition and matrix presentation.

 What I have learnt through this program :

- Understanding and analysing client needs.
- Understand and analyse the client.
- Assess sustainability solutions through a comparative analysis.
- Present a fitment matrix to the client.
